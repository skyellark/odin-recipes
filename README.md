Repo for Odin Recipe page.
I'm just going to write here and then commit to see how well this works.
However I think it's pretty self explanatory that I'll just make a simple page with a recipe for a dish or whatever, I already looked into other people's solutions and it looks like I'll have to make something similar.
This trek that I'm trekking, the web developer path, it seems to be long. I wonder how well I'll do out here.
The more I learn about the world of coding and just computer science in general the more inspired I grow. Although I'm not young enough to believe that I can make it running on just inspiration and motivation. I think that I haven't reached the level where something more profound will be the main source of fuel.

Aight, I might've gotten a little philosophical there. Time to get back to work.
